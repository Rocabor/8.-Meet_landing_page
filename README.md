## My process

### 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### 💡 What I learned

- **The CSS position Property:** The position property specifies the positioning type for an element.
The properties I used were the following:  
  - relative
  - absolute

- **CSS background-image:** property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

- **CSS linear-gradient Function:** A linear gradient defines a color transition that goes in a straight line, it can go down, up, to left, to right, or diagonally.


### 🧗‍♂️Continued development

- Frameworks

### 📖 Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - A very comprehensive resource with tutorials, explanations, and references for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found it very useful for completing this challenge and will continue to use it.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Another great resource for learning to program, and I used it to complete this challenge. I recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
